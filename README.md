# AllegroCPP project

*This is a project about making Allegro (a C library) C++, sometimes improving its functionality a bit.*

*This was tested and developed on Windows using Visual Studio and Allegro found in the nuget package manager.*

*Do you want to see my testing example? Check out [this repo](https://github.com/Lohkdesgds/AllegroCPP_Project). It should have the latest tests!*

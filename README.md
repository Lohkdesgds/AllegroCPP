# AllegroCPP project

*This is a project about making Allegro (a C library) C++, sometimes improving its functionality a bit.*

*This was tested and developed on Linux (PikaOS 4, Debian based) with CMake and GCC/G++ (current, default) with C++23.*

*There is a template in [this repo](https://github.com/Lohkdesgds/AllegroCPP_Project) to get things going. It **should** work multiplatform, but I am on Linux only now. Good luck, and, if you got fixes for Windows / MacOS, please be free to open a pull request!*
